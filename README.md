Created: 18 September 2022

### Project Title
Bikeshare

### Description
Bikeshare is a python-based script which displays information regarding bike hires across three US cities.
The program will ask a series of questions to the user (e.g. city, timeframe, stats type) and then return the data based on the chosen preferences. The menu system employed allows the user to continually change their preferences or exit the program.

### Files used
